    <h2>Roadmap:</h2>
    <hr>
<p>The BookMyShow Fullstack Capstone Project is aimed at creating a web application that enables users to book movie tickets online. The project involves several components, including the frontend, backend, database, and APIs. Here is the roadmap for the project:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Develop the frontend:</b> After designing the wireframe and prototype, the next step is to develop the frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. React can be used to create a responsive and interactive user interface.</li>
<li><b>Develop the backend:</b> The backend can be developed using Node.js and Express. APIs can be created to enable users to perform functions like booking tickets.</li>
<li><b>Create a database:</b> A database can be created using MongoDB to store booking details like movie names, movie timing, and seats.</li>
<li><b>Testing:</b> Finally, the application should be tested to ensure that it meets the requirements and functions as expected. </li>
</ol>
<p>By following this roadmap, we can create a comprehensive web application that provides a user-friendly platform for booking movie tickets.</p>
